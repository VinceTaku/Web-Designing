            <p><b>About the song:</b></p>
            <p>
                <em>Cleo Sol is an alternative RnB artist.
                I discovered her music in my matric year and I fell in love with her elegant, serene voice.
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>The song I chose as the song of the day is a track from her surprise album titled Heaven.
                It has been stuck in my head since the moment I heard it for the first time.
                I hope you enjoy it as much as I do :) </em>
