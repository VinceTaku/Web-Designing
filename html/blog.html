            <h2>Word of the Day</h2>
            <p>
                The question for this week is "can men be feminists?" and I think that they certainly can.
                 I believe that there are a lot of misconceptions about feminism, two of them being that (1) it is only for women and that (2) feminists are anti-men. 
                Both these ideas are incorrect. 
                Feminism is for everyone who wants to dismantle patriarchal oppression and fight against misogyny because ultimately, they both hurt everyone.
                 However, I think it is important that men are careful not to claim the forefront and speak over the voices of women as women are the ones most affected by patriarchy. 
                 Menâ€™s relationship to feminism should be one of allyship, solidarity and accountability. 
                 I believe that feminists do not hate men, rather they hate misogyny and the patriarchal system that continuously oppresses women.
