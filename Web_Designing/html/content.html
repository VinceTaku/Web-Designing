                <p>
                    Feminism as a broader term is the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes. When I think of the term "feminism" I am always reminded of author Chimamanda Adichie's book-length essay titled We Should All Be Feminists (highly recommended read!). In this essay Adichie argues that feminism should be embraced by all as opposed to it being seen as an insult, and defines a feminist as "a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes". So, what is intersectional feminism specifically? The term intersectionality was coined by civil rights activist and professor Kimberlé Crenshaw and can be defined as “the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.”

                <img src="../images/intersectionality is important.jpg" alt="Why intersectionality is important Image">
                <p>
                    Historically, feminism has been centered around the issues experienced by White, middle-class women. The term "white feminism" is used to describe this type of feminism, which overshadows the struggles that women of colour, LGBTQ+ women, and women of other minority groups face. “White feminism” depicts the struggles of White women as representing the struggles of all women and depicts the way white women face gender inequality as the way all women experience gender inequality, which is incorrect. Therefore, by adding the idea of intersectionality to feminism, the movement becomes truly inclusive and allows women of all races, economic standings, religions, identities, and orientations for their voices to be heard.

                <img src="../images/dismantle the patriarchy.jpg" alt="Dismantle the patriarchy Image">
                <p>
                    The dictionary definition of patriarchy is "a system of society or government in which the father or eldest male is head of the family and descent is reckoned through the male line" or, in this context, "a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it." We as a society uphold the patriarchy when we reinforce onto others gender roles and traditions on how men and women "should" act. Within these stereotypical roles of men and women, there is a power imbalance, in that men have been taught and conditioned into thinking that they should be in control and hold positions of leadership. In turn, women are treated as inferior and expected to be passive and submissive towards men. To dismantle the patriarchy means to challenge these ideas. It means to seek freedom from patriarchy and any other forms of oppression that exploit and devalue women. It means to destroy the systems in place that currently hold men as superior to all other genders and to cultivate a society that treats everyone equally.

                <h3>What is body positivity?</h3>
                <img src="../images/body positivity.jpg" alt="body positivity Image">
                <p>
                    Self-esteem is something that most women have had to work hard to build. We live in a society where women are demanded to be exceptional in the workplace and at being caretakers but are at the same time expected to not be overly confident and proud about our capabilities and achievements, objectified/reduced to their bodies and expected to fit into inconsistent and unrealistic beauty standards. The body positivity movement is therefore one of many social movements that came to be as a result of women fighting to claim autonomy and freedom from societal standards. Although the phrase “body positive” emerged in 1996, the movement in its current form began around the year 2012. Body positivity is a movement that aims to help all women to accept and love their bodies regardless of how they look or what they can do. Some of the goals of the body positivity movement include challenging how society views the body, promoting the acceptance of all bodies, helping people build confidence and acceptance of their own bodies and addressing unrealistic body standards. The movement gained popularity in pop culture and with the rise of social media. Many content creators and music artists have incorporated the message of accepting oneself and loving one’s body in their social media content and music respectively. What started out as a hashtag used by those within the fat acceptance movement quickly became a widespread movement that represented people of all body types.

                <h3>Knowing who you are</h3>
                <img src="../images/knowing who you are.jpg" alt="know who you are Image">
                <p>
                    Self-expression relates to the outward manifestation of our innermost thoughts. It is how we share pieces of ourselves with those around us. Self-expression is based on our unique quirks and traits which we express through our unique preferences and styles. Knowing who you are is closely linked to your behavior and how you express yourself. Authentic self-expression, especially as women, is what we should strive for. Being conditioned to conform to several standards makes it really hard for women to show up as their true, authentic selves. We are conditioned to adhere to beauty standards, respectability politics, gender roles, fashion trends, social status, and so much more. As a result, we become fixated on perfection and external validation (especially appeasing the male gaze), our creativity is stifled and we all follow the same trends, with no identity or sense of self outside of them. It is as Matt Haig put it in his incredible book titled Reasons to Stay Alive, “to be happy with your own non-upgraded existence [and] to be comfortable with our messy, human selves” in a society designed to force us into palatable categories and labels, “becomes kind of a revolutionary act.” No one does you better than you. Show up as nothing less than that.

                    South Africa has a dual healthcare system that features both private and public sectors. The private sectors have higher quality services and as such, they can be expensive to access. The public sector on the other hand is geographically and financially more communal and accessible. This sub-section mainly aims to provide external articles that offer detailed information on the state of women’s health care in South Africa as well as how you can affordably access a range of health care services, such as maternity care, gynaecologists, cancer screenings, fertility treatments, etc.
